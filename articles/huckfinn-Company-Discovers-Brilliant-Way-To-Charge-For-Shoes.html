        <div class="image-caption">A revolutionary "highly durable" shoe sole featuring 5% agricultural waste. The remaining 95% presumably consists of actual shoe materials.</div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Footwear manufacturer Minnetonka has revolutionized the sustainable fashion industry by convincing customers to pay premium prices for moccasins containing agricultural waste that farmers usually can't give away.</p>

            <p>The company's "Men's Tie Tread" features soles made with "highly durable recycled rice husk," a phrase that combines two words never before associated with rice husks: "highly durable" and "premium material."</p>

            <p>"We looked at the brittle waste farmers pay us to haul away and thought, 'What if we charged customers $90 for this?'" said a company spokesperson while standing in front of a PowerPoint presentation titled "Monetizing Agricultural Garbage." "Then we added a little green leaf icon and suddenly we're environmental heroes."</p>

            <div class="pullquote">
                "We looked at the brittle waste farmers pay us to haul away and thought, 'What if we charged customers $90 for this?'"
            </div>

            <p>Rice husks, which have been used for centuries as livestock bedding and landfill because of their complete lack of structural integrity, are now being celebrated as a premium sustainable material in footwear.</p>

            <p>"The beauty is in the marketing," explained the spokesperson. "We describe it as 'burned waste'—which sounds apocalyptic—rather than 'composted into fertilizer' or 'converted to renewable energy,' which sounds boringly responsible."</p>

            <p>The "highly durable" claim appears alongside the revelation that only 5% of the sole actually contains the rice husk material, with the remaining 95% presumably made from substances that won't disintegrate when exposed to moisture.</p>

            <p>"Customers never stop to ask 'Wait, why am I paying extra to walk on rice?' or 'Isn't this literally the cheapest filler on Earth?'" noted marketing analyst Jennifer Chen. "They see a green leaf and their wallets just open automatically. It's beautiful, really."</p>

            <div class="pullquote">
                "I'm essentially walking on the stuff they sweep off the floor at rice mills, and I paid a premium for it."
            </div>

            <p>Local purchaser Derek Pemberton confirmed the strategy works perfectly. "I'm essentially walking on the stuff they sweep off the floor at rice mills, and I paid a premium for it," he said proudly while photographing his moccasins for Instagram. "The planet is saved."</p>

            <p>Pemberton noted that the shoes look "exactly like regular brown moccasins," which he considers a feature rather than evidence that the 5% rice husk makes absolutely no difference to the product.</p>

            <p>When asked how long the "highly durable" rice husk sole would last, the company acknowledged that since customers replace shoes annually anyway, durability is less a product specification and more a marketing aspiration.</p>

            <p>"We prefer to think of it as 'planned sustainability,'" the spokesperson clarified. "The shoes fall apart, you buy new ones, and the cycle of eco-consciousness continues."</p>

            <p>The company also defended its decision to charge $89.95 for footwear containing what is essentially the agricultural equivalent of sawdust. "People don't want cheap shoes made with cheap materials," explained the spokesperson. "They want expensive shoes made with cheap materials that have a compelling origin story."</p>

            <p>At press time, the company announced plans for an ultra-premium "Earth Legacy" collection featuring 2% recycled sawdust for $145, along with a limited-edition line made with "responsibly sourced" corn cob fragments at $200 per pair.</p>

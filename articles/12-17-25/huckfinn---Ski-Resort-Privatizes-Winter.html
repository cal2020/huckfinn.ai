<div class="headline">SKI RESORT SUCCESSFULLY PRIVATIZES WINTER, REFERS TO SNOW AS 'THE PRODUCT'</div>
<div class="sub">Marketing Director Speaks In Language Previously Reserved For Cocaine Distribution; Longtime Visitor Discovers Mountains Contain 'Dirt,' 'Rocks'</div>

<div class="article">
<p><strong>SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, CA</strong> — In what industry experts are calling "the logical conclusion of late capitalism," Summit Ridge Resort announced this week that it has successfully manufactured an entire winter season using approximately one hot tub's worth of water, optimism, and the language of controlled substance distribution.</p>

<p>"We've probably used 500 gallons of snow to put the product we have up on the hill," said Brandon Mills, the resort's marketing director, in a statement that linguists have confirmed is indistinguishable from a cocaine dealer describing inventory management. "It's just been a waiting game with temperatures."</p>

<div class="quote">"To be honest with you, the last seven years I've been here, I've never seen this dirt. I've never seen these rocks."<br><small>— Tyler Hendricks, who apparently believed mountains were snow all the way down</small></div>

<p>The revelation that mountains contain materials other than snow came as a shock to longtime visitor Tyler Hendricks, 34, who told reporters he had visited Summit Ridge for seven consecutive years without once considering what the snow might be resting on.</p>

<p>Geologists at UC Berkeley have since confirmed that mountains are, in fact, composed primarily of rocks and dirt. "We're not sure why this is news," said Dr. Maya Rodriguez. "Has Mr. Hendricks been to third grade? We have concerns."</p>

<p>Perhaps most notable is the resort's solution: deploying snowmaking machines powered by fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming, which reduces snowfall, which necessitates more snowmaking machines. Industry analysts have dubbed this the "Ouroboros Engine."</p>

<p>"It's actually a perfect business model," explained Stanford economist Dr. Michael Chen. "They've achieved infinite demand through environmental destruction."</p>
